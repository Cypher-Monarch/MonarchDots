**A curated collection of Hyprland-centric dotfiles — clean, minimal, fast.**

> *“Why spend time looking at a boring desktop, when you can look at a pretty one.”*

MonarchDots bundles all configs that shape a cohesive Wayland environment: smooth animations, sharp fonts, responsive bars, tidy notifications, and a consistent workflow.

The setup is reproducible from a fresh install using a bootstrap script.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

MonarchDots aims to be:

* Minimal but complete
* Fast and responsive
* Visually consistent
* Reproducible from a fresh install

The goal is a system that feels cohesive rather than a loose collection of configs.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

* Arch Linux
* Wayland / Hyprland
* PipeWire + WirePlumber
* Nerd Fonts

The bootstrap installer handles most of this automatically.
